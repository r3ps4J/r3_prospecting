# r3_prospecting
#### A handler for glitchdetectors prospecting minigame made to work with QBCore

This is a QBCore adaptation using minor parts of the [prospecting with treasure map script](https://forum.cfx.re/t/esx-qbcore-prospecting-with-treasure-map/3596757).

## Features
* Randomly generated treasure within a pre-defined area
* Infinitely re-generating treasure
* Multiplayer support
* Items found come in your inventory

## How to use

A new area will be marked on the map

1. Go to the marked area
2. Use the detector item
3. Walk around while paying attention to the scanner
4. Locate and dig out treasure

You have to find a way to give players the detector item, it is the easiest to just add it to one of your stores but thats up to you.
